This is a script to grab student grades from the QConnect website (an outsourced grades management site for school districts) and render an image of the site suitable for quick'n'dirty embedding in an email.   You'll need your student's username and password for it to work, of course.

It's powered by CasperJS, so you'll need that installed to run it.
